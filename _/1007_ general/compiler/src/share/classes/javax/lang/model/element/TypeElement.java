/**
 * Represents a class or interface program element.  Provides access
 * to information about the type and its members.  Note that an enum
 * type is a kind of class and an annotation type is a kind of
 * interface.
 *
 * <p> <a name="ELEM_VS_TYPE"></a>
 * While a {@code TypeElement} represents a class or interface
 * <i>element</i>, a {@link DeclaredType} represents a class
 * or interface <i>type</i>, the latter being a use
 * (or <i>invocation</i>) of the former.
 * The distinction is most apparent with generic types,
 * for which a single element can define a whole
 * family of types.  For example, the element
 * {@code java.util.Set} corresponds to the parameterized types
 * {@code java.util.Set<String>} and {@code java.util.Set<Number>}
 * (and many others), and to the raw type {@code java.util.Set}.
 *
 * <p> Each method of this interface that returns a list of elements
 * will return them in the order that is natural for the underlying
 * source of program information.  For example, if the underlying
 * source of information is Java source code, then the elements will be
 * returned in source code order.
