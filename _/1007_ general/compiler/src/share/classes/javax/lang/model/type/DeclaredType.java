/**
 * Represents a declared type, either a class type or an interface type.
 * This includes parameterized types such as {@code java.util.Set<String>}
 * as well as raw types.
 *
 * <p> While a {@code TypeElement} represents a class or interface
 * <i>element</i>, a {@code DeclaredType} represents a class
 * or interface <i>type</i>, the latter being a use
 * (or <i>invocation</i>) of the former.
 * See {@link TypeElement} for more on this distinction.
 *
 * <p> The supertypes (both class and interface types) of a declared
 * type may be found using the {@link
 * Types#directSupertypes(TypeMirror)} method.  This returns the
 * supertypes with any type arguments substituted in.
 *
 * <p> This interface is also used to represent intersection types.
 * An intersection type is implicit in a program rather than being
 * explictly declared.  For example, the bound of the type parameter
 * {@code <T extends Number & Runnable>}
 * is an intersection type.  It is represented by a {@code DeclaredType}
 * with {@code Number} as its superclass and {@code Runnable} as its
 * lone superinterface.
